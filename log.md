# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3 - Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I completed three of the Intermediate Algorithm Scripting lessons of Free Code Camp.

**Thoughts** 
Learned the Sieve of Eratosthenes to find prime numbers. I am almost done with the intermediate section! Looking forward to starting some new projects soon.
