# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 29: February 1 - Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Daily CSS Image 6 - Clock

**Thoughts**
For this css image I played around with creating keyframes to apply to the background color so it appears as if its changing from day to night, and to the click so that the minute and hour hands move around in a circle.

### Day 28: January 31 - Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Daily CSS Image 5 - Pick your own Character. I picked Isabelle from Animal Crossing.

**Thoughts**
I have been playing a lot of Animal Crossing lately and thought I would tackle making one of the main characters. There was a lot of detail involved but it came together nicely!

### Day 27: January 30 - Monday

**Today's Progress**: Daily CSS Image 4 - Tiger

**Thoughts**
Today I made a tiger with just CSS. I think I am getting faster at putting it together and adding small details. I went with complementary colors orange and blue.

### Day 26: January 29 - Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Read Chapter 3 of Eleoquent JavaScript and worked on a new Pen

**Thoughts**
I read about Functions and scope in the book. I created a Bob-omb in CSS that will explode when clicked using JavaScript. I still have more work to do.

### Day 25: January 28 - Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on FCC JavaScript Calculator

**Thoughts**
Continued to work on the Free Code Camp JavaScript Calculator. It has some bugs still. The percent key doesn't work and the output prints only one thing at a time, so double digit numbers are not printed together.

### Day 24: January 27 - Friday

**Today's Progress**: Day 3 of dailycssimages and worked on FCC JavaScript Calculator

**Thoughts**
I made a beaver. I was trying to spend some time on the smaller details like the feet and hands but its hard to get away from just making big blobby shapes. For my JavaScript Calculator there are some things I'd like to fix, such as the decimal repeats and I only want it listed once, and for the string to not print out in full, just to have each number shown as its pressed.

### Day 23: January 26 - Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Day 2 of dailycssimages

**Thoughts**
Today while making the elephant I got good practice with box-shadow and how to make rounded objects with it.

### Day 22: January 25 - Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed Challenge30 of JavaScript30 and started the Daily CSS Images challenege.

**Thoughts**
I loved the final lesson of JavaScript30 , making a game was a lot of fun and pretty easy. I am looking forward to doing a daily image in css as well. Today was a bear.

### Day 21: January 24 - Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed Challenges 28 and 29 of JavaScript30

**Thoughts**
Todays lessons were math and date heavy which is great because I can always use more practice with pulling that kind of data from the browser. I'm going to put what I learned from the countdown timer to use with the pomodoro timer I'll be starting as a project for free code camp.

### Day 20: January 23 - Monday

**Today's Progress**: Completed Challenges 26 and 27 of JavaScript30

**Thoughts**
Stripe has always been on every list of great responsive websites. I was excited to learn how they did their navigation and realize there is a lot involved in the smallest details sometimes. I am thinking of using the click and drag methods we learned into a slideshow for the projects here. It might be a good way to display each one and what I've learned.

### Day 19: January 22 - Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Completed Challenges 24 and 25 of JavaScript30

**Thoughts**
Loved the sticky nav lesson. When creating them I always felt like I was doing it the hard way. This way is cleaner and it prevents the navbar from acting weird when scrolling. I'll implement this into future projects. The second lesson went a bit over my head but I put a lot of notes down so I can reference it again. I believe stopPropagation will come in handy in the future.

### Day 18: January 20 - Friday

**Today's Progress**: Completed Challenges 22 and 23 of JavaScript30

**Thoughts**
I look forward to continuing the link highlighting project in a futher video. The speech one was a lot of fun and it's always interesting to find out what APIs are already built into your browser and how to manipulate them.

### Day 17: January 19 - Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on my portfolio and started the Free Code Camp JavaScript calculator

**Thoughts** 
My portfolio is up! I like how it came out. I put the finishing touches on it with links and made sure it looked ready for both mobile and desktop. Now I am working on Free Code Camp's JavaScript Calculator. I finished the HTML and CSS for it. Now I need to get it to come to life with JavaScript. I made it look like a children's calculator. Enjoying it so far!

### Day 16: January 18 - Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed Challenges 20 and 21 of JavaScript30

**Thoughts** 
Today was a bit rough. I loved the dictation lesson but Chrome refused to let the local host allow my microphone so I couldn't test it. Not sure if it's because I was using a local host, but no matter how often I forced 'Allow' on it, it would immediately go back to block. The second project I couldn't really complete because I do not have xcode install to use the iphone simulator. I am running out of room on my laptop and can't install it. But! I was able to follow along which still counted for something right?

### Day 15: January 17 - Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed Challenges 18 and 19 of JavaScript30

**Thoughts** 
Loved the explination for exactly how this: % works. Finally understand how to use it. 
Never knew how to work with the webcam, and also got to create a localhost. Learned a lot today.

### Day 14: January 16 - Monday

**Today's Progress**: Completed Challenges 16 and 17 of JavaScript30

**Thoughts** 
For the first project I had made the error of putting a period before an h1 tag in the query selector and it took me a while to find and fix. I guess that's what happens when you work while tired. I feel like I am getting more familiar with manipulating the page and formulas for X and Y. The second one we used RegEx to remove the | an | and from a sort.

### Day 13: January 15 - Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Completed Challenge 15 of JavaScript30

**Thoughts** 
Learning how to use the local storage in my developer tools under the application tab was interesting. I clicked around in there but did not know you can look at arrays there and manipulate them from that tab.

### Day 12: January 14 - Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Completed Challenge 14 of JavaScript30 and Solved a Kata on CodeWars.com

**Thoughts** 
The JavaScript30 challenge was going over the difference between Referencing and Copying. The Kata involed counting the number of vowels in a string. I used regex which I find I am getting more comfortable with.

### Day 11: January 13 - Friday

**Today's Progress**: Completed Challenges 12 and 13 of JavaScript30

**Thoughts** 
The use of cornify in the first challenge is so funny. I want to use that on everything. The secret code is my first name. For the second challenge, in the past I've used the plugin Waypoints to do this. I like that I now know how to do it with plain JavaScript, and may try to go back to past projects and replace it with my own code.

### Day 10: January 12 - Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Completed Challenge 11 of JavaScript30

**Thoughts** 
Today's project was really interesting - I got to change the layout of a video player. I felt accomplished when I was able to add the fullscreen option at the end without help using the Fullscreen API.

### Day 9: January 11 - Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed Challenge 9 and 10 of JavaScript30

**Thoughts** 
Got to learn about all the different types of console logs to use within the developer tools, and how to select multiple checkboxes holding down the shift key.

### Day 8: January 10 - Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed Challenge 7 and 8 of JavaScript30

**Thoughts** 
Built my first canvas. Enjoyed learning about hue and will be using [Mothereffing HSL](http://mothereffinghsl.com/) as a reference in the future.

### Day 7: January 9 - Monday

**Today's Progress**: Completed Challenge 6 of JavaScript30

**Thoughts** 
I liked this project because I was able to practice using regular expressions to search, and sort by city and state. I also learned about using fetch and .then with JSON instead of going through the parsing or get methods.

### Day 6: January 8 - Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Completed Challenge 5 of JavaScript30

**Thoughts** 
This project was heavy on CSS transitions. Sometimes I forget that it takes very little JavaScript to make animations, a lot of it comes from CSS that just a few lines of JavaScript can put into action. In this case it was just toggeling between classes on a mouseclick.

### Day 5: January 7 - Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Finished up the Intermediate Algorithm Section of Free Code Camp!

**Thoughts** 
I read up more about a for...in loop which was needed for the Everything Be True challenge. I think the difference is normally I am used to iterating over an Array where you need to have an index order. So you can use for...in when the order is not important.

### Day 4: January 6 - Friday

**Today's Progress**: I created Project 4 of the JavaScript30 Challenge - Array Cardio 1

**Thoughts** 
I didn't realize that there was also a console.table() . It made reading the data so much easier in the console. I really liked in this lesson that we were taught two ways to manipulate the arrays - one way was a detailed so I understood the code once it was broken down, and the other was a shortened version so that I use less code for the same thing.

### Day 3: January 5 - Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I created Project 3 of the JavaScript30 Challenge - CSS Variables

**Thoughts** 
I learned how to make variables within CSS using var(-- ). So whatever color the user chooses, it will update on the header, border, and links.

### Day 2: January 4 - Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I completed three of the Intermediate Algorithm Scripting lessons of Free Code Camp.

**Thoughts** 
I seem to always try to make things more complicated then they are. For Steamroller I spent a while trying to turn the array into a string to then make into an array again, before giving up and learning about flattening it instead.

### Day 1: January 3 - Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I completed three of the Intermediate Algorithm Scripting lessons of Free Code Camp.

**Thoughts** 
Learned the Sieve of Eratosthenes to find prime numbers. I am almost done with the intermediate section! Looking forward to starting some new projects soon.
