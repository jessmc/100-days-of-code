# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 3: January 5 - Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I created Project 3 of the JavaScript30 Challenge - CSS Variables

**Thoughts** 
I learned how to make variables within CSS using var(-- ). So whatever color the user chooses, it will update on the header, border, and links.

### Day 2: January 4 - Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I completed three of the Intermediate Algorithm Scripting lessons of Free Code Camp.

**Thoughts** 
I seem to always try to make things more complicated then they are. For Steamroller I spent a while trying to turn the array into a string to then make into an array again, before giving up and learning about flattening it instead.

**Today's Progress**: I completed three of the Intermediate Algorithm Scripting lessons of Free Code Camp.

**Thoughts** 
Learned the Sieve of Eratosthenes to find prime numbers. I am almost done with the intermediate section! Looking forward to starting some new projects soon.
