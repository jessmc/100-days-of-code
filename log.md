# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 4: January 6 - Friday

**Today's Progress**: I created Project 4 of the JavaScript30 Challenge - Array Cardio 1

**Thoughts** 
I didn't realize that there was also a console.table() . It made reading the data so much easier in the console. I really liked in this lesson that we were taught two ways to manipulate the arrays - one way was a detailed so I understood the code once it was broken down, and the other was a shortened version so that I use less code for the same thing.

### Day 3: January 5 - Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I created Project 3 of the JavaScript30 Challenge - CSS Variables

**Thoughts** 
I learned how to make variables within CSS using var(-- ). So whatever color the user chooses, it will update on the header, border, and links.

### Day 2: January 4 - Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I completed three of the Intermediate Algorithm Scripting lessons of Free Code Camp.

**Thoughts** 
I seem to always try to make things more complicated then they are. For Steamroller I spent a while trying to turn the array into a string to then make into an array again, before giving up and learning about flattening it instead.

### Day 1: January 3 - Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I completed three of the Intermediate Algorithm Scripting lessons of Free Code Camp.

**Thoughts** 
Learned the Sieve of Eratosthenes to find prime numbers. I am almost done with the intermediate section! Looking forward to starting some new projects soon.
